# **Calculation of the electric invoice**

_This project calculates the readings and with these 
readings it informs the electrical consumption of the month._

_Having the consumption, the system asks to inform which flag is in effect.
Every 100 kilowatt hours, depending on the band, it has its calculation._
***
## Flags

1. Green: There is no increase in the value of electricity bills

2. Yellow: Every 100 kilowatt hours
consumed, R$ 1.35 is added to invoices
3. ** Red has two levels: **
4. Level one -> R$ 4.17 is added for every 100 kilowatt hours consumed
5. Level two-> This value rises to 6.24 per 100 kilowatt hours.

### Next steps
***
1. Improve the code
2. Create an app
